58. configure which-key
59. change lazy loading
63. configure markdown - don't close on tab change
64. check out luarocks
66. zen mode is working only once
67. check out TODO keymaps
69. Typing 'o' open new line at wrong indent for e.g. lua files (2 spaces instead of 4), also tabs don't work
70. On PC, the which-key code in init.lua doesn't work
71. when using j and k, there shouldn't be any lag (faster moving up and down)
62. Set up Jupyter Notebooks

63. Remove deprecated error (:checkhealth vim.deprecated)
64. Shift + K or J should display border or different bg color
66. Make space+l/b/u add characters to make font bold/italic/underlined (for Neorg)
67. Add debugging support for JS / TS - needed for Node.js
68. Configure nvim-dap-virtual-text
69. resolve git conflicts better (diffview.nvim)
70. nvim-dap-python doesn't work
71. Switch to a stable version of Telescope when a release occurs (from master branch)

Awesome Neovim:
- Lspsaga

final tweaks:
- clean up init.lua
- change tree structure (if not - move gitsigns to plugins.lua), set lazy load on events
- add description to keymaps (for which-key)
- add documentation
